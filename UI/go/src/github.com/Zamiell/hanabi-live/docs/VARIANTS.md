# Variants

Hanabi Live is programmed by Hanabi enthusiasts who have played thousands of games. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using the variants mentioned in the [rules that come with the game](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants) as well as many other non-official custom variants. Players also have the ability to further custom a game by using a number of [custom game options](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.md#custom-game-options).

<br />

### No Variant

* This is the "base" game, with 5 suits. Unlike some real-life versions of the game, Hanabi Live uses the following five suit colors:
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Yellow
  * Red
  * Purple

### Six Suits

* An teal suit is added.
* It works identical to the other suits in that you can clue teal cards with teal clues.
* (This is the first [official variant](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants).)

### Four Suits

* The purple suit is removed.

### Three Suits

* The red and purple suits are removed.

### Black

* One of the suits is replaced with a black suit.
* It works similar to the other suits in that you can clue black cards with black clues.
* There is only one of each black card in the deck, which means that every black card is "critical".
* (This is the second [official variant](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants).)

### Rainbow

* One of the suits is replaced with a rainbow suit.
* All color clues will "touch" the rainbow suit.
* (This is the third [official variant](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants).)

### Pink

* One of the suits is replaced with a pink suit.
* All rank clues "touch" the pink suit.

### White

* One of the suits is replaced with a white suit.
* No color clues "touch" the white suit. (It is a colorless suit.)

### Brown

* One of the suits is replaced with a brown suit.
* No rank clues "touch" the brown suit.

### Dark Rainbow (Black + Rainbow)

* One of the suits is replaced with a dark rainbow suit.
* All color clues will "touch" the dark rainbow suit.
* There is only one of each dark rainbow card in the deck, which means that every dark rainbow card is "critical".

### Dark Pink (Black + Pink)

* One of the suits is replaced with a dark pink suit.
* All rank clues will "touch" the dark pink suit.
* There is only one of each dark pink card in the deck, which means that every dark pink card is "critical".

### Gray (Black + White)

* One of the suits is replaced with a gray suit.
* No color clues "touch" the gray suit. (It is a colorless suit.)
* There is only one of each gray card in the deck, which means that every gray card is "critical".

### Chocolate (Black + Brown)

* One of the suits is replaced with a chocolate suit.
* No rank clues "touch" the brown suit.
* There is only one of each chocolate card in the deck, which means that every chocolate card is "critical".

* All color clues will "touch" the light rainbow suit.
* No rank clues will "touch" the light rainbow suit.

### Light Pink

### Multi-Fives

* Fives are "touched" by all rank clues.
* Players cannot clue rank 5.

### Prism-Ones

* Ones are "touched" by all color clues.

### Clue Starved

* Each discard only generates 0.5 clues. (The team still starts with 8 clues.)

### Up or Down

* This variant was invented by [Sean McCarthy on the BoardGameGeek forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30863162).
* Two 1's are removed from each suit.
* One "START" card is added to each suit.
* When a stack is empty, you can play either a 1, a 5, or a START card on it.
* When a stack has a START card on it, you can play either a 2 or a 4 on it.
* If a stack was started with a 1 (or a START + 2), then it works as a normal stack.
* If a stack was started with a 5 (or a START + 4), then it must be completed in reverse.
* A clue token is given when a stack is completed, regardless of whether it is a normal stack or a reversed stack.

### Cow & Pig

* When players give a clue, they point at the cards clued, but say "moo" if it a color clue and "oink" if it is a rank clue.

### Duck

* This variant was invented by Jack Gurev's group.
* When players give a clue, they point at the cards clued, but say "quack" instead of a color or number.
